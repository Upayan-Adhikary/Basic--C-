/*
vector<int>: Pass by value (makes a copy, rarely recommended for large vectors).
vector<int>&: Pass by reference (allows modifications to the original vector).
const vector<int>&: Pass by reference but read-only (efficient for large vectors that donâ€™t need modification).

Using & helps improve performance and allows flexibility in how the vector is handled.
